# GoGoal [under development]
-This is a unity3D - Android game
-This game is based on _Ball in a Maze_.

## How it will works :-
- It will be an android build, so it is using Android gyro sensor and according to that the main plateform will lean to gyro.
- Due to plateform movement rigidbody ball will move on its own due to slope.
- TO finish level you need to put the ball in the dizered place.
- This game has 4 spawn points which are four corner of rectangle, square maze.
- The Spawn point is choosen by user before the game starts.
- _*Need an Camera switch Animation while choosing the spawn point*_
